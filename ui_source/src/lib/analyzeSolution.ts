/**
 * MathMentor AI — Solution analysis (STUB)
 *
 * This stub mirrors the real pipeline so swapping it later is easy:
 *   1. Compare each submitted step against the problem bank's ground truth.
 *   2. Rule-based pass first: format/parse, incomplete, and sign-error labels.
 *   3. If unclear, "predict" with a mock logistic-regression model AND a mock
 *      DNN; report confidence from whichever has the lower estimated error.
 *   4. On model disagreement, fall back to concept_gap or
 *      algebra_transformation_error.
 *   5. Pick 1 of 3 prebuilt explanation messages for the chosen label.
 *
 * TODO(real version): replace compareStep with a SymPy-based symbolic check,
 * replace mockLogisticRegression / mockDNN with calls to the hosted models,
 * and use calibrated per-model validation error for the confidence choice.
